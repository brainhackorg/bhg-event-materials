# Guideline for Leading and Attending to Brainhack Projects


## Compiled By
Isil Bilgin, Anibal S√≥lon Heinsfeld

## Before You Start

Here we aim to collect advices and suggestions currated from the many previous years' project leaders and attendees as the best practices
of running successful, collaborative projects that would lead high impact and successful outputs in the given short amount of time. The 
main aim of the Brainhacks is being inclusive, removing the borders and limits and increasing the information and experience exchange 
between the members of the project members. In the light of these aims, we encourage and support each single individual to be part of 
the whole event either as a project leader or attendee to get the highest benefit from the event.

This document will be developed over time with the feedbacks. Please bear with us, we will work on finishing the document soon. In the mean
time please go through the below links that provides good starting points in working in and leading an open science projects collaboratively.


# Leading a Virtual Project üï∏üåê
Leading a hackathon project comes with a set of responsibilities, coordinating skills and ability to create a welcoming environment especially for the newcomers. Usually newcomers are highly likely to lack information about where to look for the right sources, tools and answers to their questions. They might be lacking the understanding of what is a Brainhack project means and how to contribute to the project during and after the event finishes. They might need a clear guidance and pointers from the start to the end. As the project leader you should have clear project goals, a set of skill sets that you desire to get contributions toward, the list of tasks to assign to the team members, and an accompanying time schedule that would allow both finishing the tasks accordingly and allow project attendees to engage with the other events through the Brainhack (eg. Trainracks, coffee breaks, biological needs, family duties, resting). Please always keep that in mind that, once you were a new comer too. Be polite, respectful, and show your support to the attendees. 

As a project leader, it is recommended to keep your projects as broad as possible to give contribution chances to the researchers across many different backgrounds and career levels: being inclusive is at the heart of project leading. You are expected to define the scope of the projects so you can invite participation and contribution to your project. 

Every event organization comes up with their own rules and recommendations regarding the use of the tools and the scope of the projects together with how to address the main questions at hand, or how to pitch and run your projects: make sure that you read and understand those organizational requests and follow those rules. 

Independently from the event itself, make sure that you always encourage and address diversity and inclusivity in your projects, to give place and opportunities to the attendees from all different types of career level, diversity groups and create platforms, chances to learn from them and contribute towards knowledge exchanges between each contributor. Make sure you are open to the ideas, listening to your attendees, directing them through the necessary paths to be taken to achieve their task and encouraging them to contribute as much as they can. 

Once you create your team, you should be running the first meeting to share all the necessary details and listen to your attendees regarding their will in participating and their skill sets that they can contribute with. As the project leader your role is to coordinate the project with all the necessary elements from communication between the attendees, onboarding the newcomers onto the project, helping attendees to achieve a task and making sure the environment is kept welcoming throughout the whole event. 

Before starting to your project and working group, please make sure that you and your team members are all read and clear about the [Code of Conduct](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11aE6vv67i9pzOUN7DTypqiAVUutXAijP7_jZTURHhAM/edit), and abide with the policy of the [Code of Conduct](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11aE6vv67i9pzOUN7DTypqiAVUutXAijP7_jZTURHhAM/edit).

## Before the Project Pitching

- Define the aim and goal of the project
- Open a Github Repo or Google Drive folder associated with the project
- Open a communication channel or share the details for how to communicate with the project leaders for further queries regarding the project, project attendance, and preparations before the hackathon.
- Prepare a README regarding the project, place a link to it prominently on your Github issue
- Put all of the documentation, guideline, data files, previous codes regarding the project in your Github repo/ Google folder, place a link to it prominently on your Github issue
- List the goal of the project explicitly.
- List the roles/tasks required to complete the project
(List all the requisites from the team members/team member specs to make it easy to apply for your project.) Invite all possible contributor personas with various different backgrounds and expertise explicitly, to enhance inclusivity. For example, ‚ÄúWe need graphic designers to help us design the user interface. We need python enthusiasts to implement some new functionalities. We need novices for testing our interface and helping us write documentation.‚Äù etc.
- List all the prerequisites for tools, software, containers to use in your project in order to give enough time to the project attendees to set their workspace ready before the event. 
- Prepare quick tutorials or documentation that would help/facilitate the contribution from any attendee who does not have enough experience in the area or link to existing resources. Similarly link to tutorials and courses relevant to your project, so participants do not feel lost when aiming at taking a python course. Here, you can find a super nicely curated list to choose from (https://learn-neuroimaging.github.io/tutorials-and-resources/). This will gain a lot of time to deal with installation/preparation related time lost. 
- Create a GitHub keyword pool/tags that are associated with your project for easy search/identifiability
- Create a timeline of the tasks to be done during the event
- Choose a communication tool to chat with your project members (e.g. https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/your-project-channel)
- Choose a video communication tool to run meetings with your project members (e.g. meet.jit.si or discord.com)
- Prepare a project pitching presentation that fits with the organization‚Äôs time limits and requests, and think about a range of skill sets you are looking for. At the beginning of the hackathon, you will get 2 minutes to present your project with 2-3 slides.
- Prepare rooms for unconferences, quick training sessions in your time schedule that would help with the less experienced attendees to benefit from and encourage the experience exchange. 
- Create entry-level issues on Github, and label them as ‚Äúgood first issues‚Äù
- If you are aiming to run a project that already started with few contributors in, stimulate a team effort to welcome and integrate newcomers alongside the experienced team members so they feel invited to join, and know who would be the person closest to what they wish to contribute 
- Deploy easy documentation tools/processes that could be used and contributed by any attendees of the project, in order to keep the track of the project progress and keep everyone on track.  
- Prepare a one-paragraph summary text that you can send to interested attendees that contact you via e-mail/ Twitter/ ‚Ä¶ Link to your readme and documentation if they have further questions.
- Look for co-leaders! They do not necessarily need to be involved in the ‚Äúplanning‚Äù for the content, but they might be very helpful in taking care of your attendees during the project. Co-leaders should know about the tasks/ goals/ schedule before the project starts.
- Make sure you are documenting your project well enough for the further use and contributors in the future which will include all the necessary instructions from installation to building the source, from using to how to contribute with all the necessary dependencies and licences, extensions and example data and links to the related documents and sources. Keep your documentation as simple, easy read and clear as possible given your users/contributors will not be only experts from the field but such approach will help you to have more contributions from wider contributors. 
- Make sure every single contribution given by the members of the team are clearly listed in the documentations, repositories, acknowledgements and citings, with the list of the contributions given by those. 

## Project Ideas


Hackathons are strengthening the community and promoting the exchange of the information and knowledge across the communities. Therefore do not expect to solve hard field problems but try to come up with a project that is missing in terms of the practicality of the methods or tools that will allow both you and your attendees to gain and learn from it and will provide practical use for the community. 
Make sure that your aims to achieve with your project are realistic to obtain within the given amount of time and they do not cause any extra pressure on your project attendees.
Use the presentation format provided and requested by the hackathon organizing committee for your project pitch presentation. 

## Project Pitching

Keep the aim and scope of the project clear and understandable for the audience. 

- You can invite a range of skill sets you are looking for :) so for people very unfamiliar with your research question, they still feel ah, I could contribute here
- Share the contact information in your presentation which is visible to the audience.
- Make sure you know your order in the presentation queue. 
- If your presentation is asked to be shared with the organizers make sure you hand it in, in time.
- At the very first hours of the event, you encounter with many interests and questions regarding your project so be prepared to welcome new attendees, repeat your explanations; direct team members who joined earlier to documentation/ the readme you have written 
- Be prepared to explain all steps verbally to all participants. Allocate time for that. Best is to have a centralized meeting at the beginning of the day where everybody listens.
- Please do not forget, there are cases you might end up having less number of attendees for your project than you actually aimed for or even none. In such a situation please don‚Äôt get desperate/ frustrated at first. Because people might be checking with the other projects they might end up in yours. Therefore keeping the communication channels open would be the right way to do. 
- It might be a better strategy to not to stick up with elaborate explanations to the first few attendees that join, but rather having a well written and a brief project explanation document somewhere that you can point to. 

## After Submitting a Project

Follow the organization‚Äôs instruction regarding project preparations
Create a spreadsheet or survey to collect the interests of the prospective attendees together with the related information regarding their skill set, interests, and their will in helping in project associated tasks.
Share the link of the sources and materials/tutorials/instructions with the interested attendees.
Run a QA regarding the project initialization and running.


## Kicking-off the Project


- Run a discussion with the participants regarding the distribution of the tasks.
- Have multiple people in the project lead (at least 2)---looks much more convincing and gives the impression that at least two people have thought about the schedule and tasks/ goals; one project leader takes care of ‚Äúexperienced‚Äù, one of ‚Äúless experienced‚Äù members
- Create a spreadsheet for the distribution of the roles among the attendees.
- Decide on the tools, communication channels to be used throughout the project together with the project attendees
- Decide on the unconferences, quick tutorial needs together with the attendees based on their needs
- Decide on the time schedule of the task and revise your timeline of the project accordingly. 
- Make sure a timeline of your project execution includes enough breaks throughout the day allowing enough flexibility to the attendees from different time zones, family duties, and biological needs, etc. 
- Follow the fair share of the sources and opportunities across the attendees.
- Make sure you follow the timeline you agreed regarding the break times and encourage your attendees to follow and respect it.
- Make sure you and your team members read and understand the [Code of Conduct](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11aE6vv67i9pzOUN7DTypqiAVUutXAijP7_jZTURHhAM/edit).


## Running the Project

- Make sure you and your team members follow the Code of Conduct in their interactions through each of the communication channels and platforms.
- Make sure you guide your team members to direct the help from the right team members to the ones in need. 
- To be more organized prepare a calendar/Gantt chart or use a todo tracking system together with the team members on the agreed term, in order to facilitate dissemination of the tasks and assigning due dates to each of the tasks. 
- Be open to the questions and help requests from the attendees. 
- Be open to your project attendees to work on several projects and support free movement between the project contributions.
- If the number of the members is sufficient to have the 'sub-team', divide the tasks among those sub-teams to facilitate the collaboration (eg. arranging the meeting time). In this case, the sub-team can work on their task then meet altogether by the beginning/ end of the day to discuss the progress.
- Run several social events like online lunch, drink, chat meetings to increase and encourage flexible exchange and interaction.
- You could have one virtual room connected ‚Äúall the time‚Äù where people know they can reach you just like coming over to your table IRL, eg meet.jit.si/your-project
- List the contributors with their contributions in your Github/project repository to make sure every attendee is represented (You could follow the example of the Turing institute, using their contributor bot (link), or just copy-paste the lines of code into the bottom of your ReadMe file and adapt to your team members (link to an example, could be the tutorials and resources repo for example)
- Make sure you give enough thought to the suggestions and discussions regarding any aspects of the running/realization of the projects that come from any single individual from the project.
- Give regular pauses to the project to revise the project‚Äôs progress, with which aims are achieved, and which tasks are remaining to be completed to refresh the minds and will give an award and acknowledgment about the work the project members did/doing.
- In regular pauses, you might think of redistributing the roles again, to give everyone enough opportunities to contribute to the project and benefit from different points of view and expertise, which will also take a load of a single task from one person to conduct. 
- Kindly encourage documenting the processes to share later on in your repositories as metadata to be benefited as the case study by the fellow researchers that aims to follow the same footpath. 
- As many projects do not finish after 3 days, we encourage writing a summary paragraph of latest progress into a continuous place (Google Doc or HackPad, or one synchronous GitHub issue) every once in a while, targeted at keeping the team synched even if a member has to take a short break from the project, and also as a good place to go for newcomers who would like to join but missed the start of the project.
- Such documentation will also help quickly gather together a report or a demo presentation at the end of the event. 
- Give biological and social breaks throughout the event to give your team members enough private time schedules and some spaces to socialize.
- Make sure neither you as the project leader or any of the project members behave demanding regarding finishing the tasks that would exhaust any team members including you and prevents the main aspect of participating in the hackathon project. 
- For virtual events, many team members might have other obligations (child care, lab meetings, doctors‚Äô appointments) that make them drop out of the project from time to time. - Encourage your attendees to share when they‚Äôll be off beforehand, and take it into account when distributing tasks and tracking progress on subtasks.
- Even if you prepare many documents about project goals (README, time schedule, links to relevant resources,...), attendees might not read them, but demand you to explain it to them in person. Schedule enough time at the beginning of the project and at the start of each day to centrally explain the goals for the day. Preparing those documents might help you get a clear idea about your plans and goals, but you need to be able to quickly summarize them to your attendees.
- People from other time zones might spontaneously ask you if they can join you. Be prepared that those people will join you at much earlier/ later times of the day, and might be disappointed if you stop your daily work on the project earlier/ later than they would do given their time zone. Consider this in task allocation. You might have to explain your daily goals etc. separately to them. This is quite some extra work. Thus, consider just saying ‚Äúno‚Äù and keeping a project restricted to your own time zone.
- For virtual hackathons, your attendee might be dropping in and out because they have other responsibilities over the day (lab meetings, doctors‚Äô appointments,....). To avoid inefficiencies due to such irregularities in contributions it is better to make a schedule (spreadsheet) of the days, ask participants to indicate their availability, allocate tasks accordingly. 
- In the case of a change in the schedule of the project, plans make sure you notify the project attendees well advanced. 
- Make sure the project time plan allows flexible movements across the time to give a chance to all attendees to attend train tracks or their personal commitments as necessary. 

## Finalizing the Project

- Run a wrap-up meeting with your attendees to emphasize the work has been done and the remaining tasks. 
- Agree on how to continue beyond the 3-day hack: follow up meetings over a coffee once every 2 weeks? Milestones needed to reach the end of the project etc. Join the BrainWeb (https://brain-web.github.io/)
- Gather comments from your project attendees‚Äô regarding their experiences in contributing to the project, what do they feel about their gain networking and information exchanging aspect of the hackathon.
- Collect feedback from your attendees regarding the pros and cons of running the project and about the future aspect of the project
- Decide on how to lead the project demo presentation. Enquire the format of the demo presentation from the organizers.
- Create a publicly shared presentation that each of your project attendees could contribute. 
- Keep the presentation short and clear to be understood by all of the audience.
- Make sure you give enough representation to each events‚Äô attendees in the final project demos/presentation. While the project pitch is of course by the project lead, the project progress and results presentation could be mainly done by the team :)
- Acknowledge all your project attendees by name (photo) in your presentation.
- Make sure you do not use any image/media that violates copyrights or consent of the attendees.
- Make sure your presentation will fit into the time allocated or your presentation
- Make sure you know your place in the order of the presentation queue.

## Project Aftermath 

- If the project is not finalized as planned within the given time, make sure you continue to the project after the main hack event with a new timeline and plan regarding the remaining works to be completed.
- Make sure the after hackathon period will require the dedication of the time from each individual‚Äôs personal timeline, make a timeline that will not exhaust any of the attendee‚Äôs continuity in participation.
- Take notes regarding which aspects you find difficult or easy in running virtual projects and contribute to this very guideline.
- Make sure you give enough representation to each contributor?.
- Make sure you collect feedback from your event organizers and project attendees regarding how the project progress and works are run throughout the project execution.
- Make sure you follow the procedures that might lead to a collaborative publication. 


# Being a Team Member of a Virtual Project üëØ
Collaborating online, team and project management

## Before the Project Pitching

Since the project pitches are designed to give a very quick and brief overview of the projects, it would be helpful if you could have a look at the projects listed in the Brainhack from the regarding pages to make sure you have at least several options to choose from. 

Therefore before the project pitches, do not forget to browse among the projects, their related sources (repository, chat channels, provided sources, materials, the skill sets required for the projects, the goal of the project) to make sure you have ideas ready.
Make sure you read and follow the Code of Conduct

## Project Pitching

During the project, pitches take notes regarding the given information. If there is a Q&A session ask your questions regarding working in the project. 

## Kicking Off the Project

- Go to the related chat rooms to contact the project leaders to show your interest to them.
- Follow the protocol that the project lead set up regarding listing the required skills or indicating the interests you can contribute towards the project to help the project - leader to distribute the roles fairly.
- If you plan to work on several projects, please indicate this to your project leaders. 
- If you are a latecomer due to the difficulties you encountered in finding the right project that suits your skills/interests well or had technical difficulties to participate in the event from the first day of the event, please do not hesitate to communicate with the event organizers to help you in finding the right project to participate in. - - - -- Similarly, please do not hesitate to contact the project leads and share your skill sets and interests. The project leaders are always happy to welcome newcomers and all help requests. 
- Follow the directions regarding the initial kick-off meeting. 
- Introduce yourself, your interests, how you can contribute to the project to all other participants.
- Make sure you are familiar with the project goals, time schedule, the distribution of the roles among the team members. 
- If there is a list of within-project unconference sessions, make sure you do not hesitate to propose giving one on the topic you think would be helpful for the rest of the project attendees for the improvement of the project. 
- Make sure you indicate the information/the skill set you are lacking for the particular project and require help from the other team members to avoid any struggle along the way. 
- Make sure you share the necessary communication handles/information of yours with the team members

## Running the Project

- Make sure you follow the Code of Conduct all the way through project execution. 
- Make sure you issue the project improvements/the task you completed in the following project kanban/repo/platforms to keep track of the project.
- Make sure you are in coordination with the team leader and members, using the chat channels continuously, attending to the video chats, and sharing your work and improvements in a regular way with a summary. 
- Make sure you take the initiative in the decisions or helping others when they are stuck in the tasks they are doing as much as you can. 
- Make sure you ask your questions without hesitating, through the general chat channels of the project. 
- Make sure you also attend to the breaks, train tracks as you need to share this with the project leads and members. 
- Make sure you follow the timeline of the project to finish the tasks as it was planned. 
- Make sure the discussions are run in the communication channels and follow kind and fair opportunities among all. 
- Do not hesitate to share your ideas and suggestions throughout the project.
- Do not hesitate to give feedback and communicate with the project leaders regarding the issues and questions you have. You should not suffer among problems, but only enjoy your participation in the project, learn from it, and enjoy sharing the knowledge. This is why the Brainhacks for. 
- Make sure you help with the documentation aspect of the contributions you make and the necessary information as required.
- In some cases (eg. due to the lack of members) the project lead might request the shift of some laboring on another task. Please be open to such changes in the role across the task. Eventually, this is a community project, and every single contribution counts.

## Finalizing the Project

- Please attend the wrap-up meeting if your leader holds one to get the input from you regarding which tasks are completed/ which expects to be done and present them in the general wrap up session. 
- Give your contributions to the wrap-up demo presentations as necessary
- If you are asked to give a project pitch, do not hesitate to take the initiative and go for it.

## Project Aftermath

- If the project is not finalized as planned within the given time, make sure you continue to the project after the main hack event. 
- Please share your comments/feedback with your project leader regarding the whole project experience to make the experiences better next time for both your leader and other attendees
- Make sure you follow the procedures that might lead to a collaborative publication.
